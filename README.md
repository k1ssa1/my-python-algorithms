# my-python-algorithms
Common algorithms used in python

Welcome to the "my-python-algorithms" repository!
This is my personal playground where I'll be experimenting with all the data structures and algorithms that my little brain can handle.

As I learn new things, this repository will evolve and grow like a beautiful tree (🌳) in springtime. You can navigate through the branches (🌱) of this tree to find all the different algorithm types, each in their own folder.

In each folder, you'll find different algorithms represented as modules (🧱). These modules can be executed in the "output.py" file (📝) to see the magic happen. It's like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.

So come on in, make yourself at home (🏡) and let's learn some cool stuff together!
